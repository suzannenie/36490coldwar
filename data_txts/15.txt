your note to me concerning the SPD attack on RFE for

its treatment of Imre Nagy, I have not been able to locate the note which

you refer to -- the one from | fo you -= but the attached cable seems

to be on same subject, Additionally, during my two days in NY I had a chance

to hear Delgado discourse on the subject of Hungary. Although I did not know

about this Nagy/RFE flare up at the time, it is now abundantly clear to me that

Delgado knew about it and was getting all the mileage he could out of mak

what seemed to me to be nothing more than hindsight but which now is clearly

an offspring of the latest development in the game of trying to tag RFE with

some culpability in the Hungarian affair, Delgado was most emphatic in his

statements that the big mistake of RFE during the revolution was its treatment of

Imre Nagy. His discussion grew out of a discussion of the need for policy

guidance and he seemed to me, at least, to be using the Nagy treatment theme to

point out that RFE received no guidance on the subject. Or, in acknowledgment of

my increasingly Machiavellian thought processes, I might state that his motivation

could have been to make an impression which would be present when we got into the

subject and discovered that NY guidances were fairly moderate and restrained on the

subject of Nagy and Mmich guidances were on the aggressive side, At least that is

the picture one gets in reading the outline which RFE prepared for the Kelly

Conmittees

Whatever may be the RFE inner machination in the matter the

fact is that RFE did attack Nagy.

can summarize them as follows:

I have read again the Hungarian scripts and

A. From 23 thra 31 October not only did Nagy get no breaks from RFE, he

was very openly and uncompromisingly attacked with such admonitions

as advice that the Hungarians should put no faith in him since he was nothing but
a Communist of the died in the wool order and they could expect nothing from hin,
ete. He was accused of being me nothing but another Muscpvite stooge. In general,
RFE gave him the complete works, urging Hungarians to view his statement and his
acts as being only in the interests of the Soviets,

B, It was not until 1 Novemebr that any sort of let-up on the attacks
against Nagy could be discerned and that was a backhand deal which, even in the
face of the Russian withdrawal, went out of the way to point out that even if the
Nagy Govt survived there could be no guaranty that Hungary would not fall back into
the old regime ways. It made specific condematory refernces to the number of
compromised members of the Nagy Govt, and did not in any way temper the condemnation
with hope that the presente of the few non-Commie members would indicate hope for
the futures

Ce. On 2 Novemebr RFE with Gellert talking (or maybe it was authored by
Gellert) made its first sympathetic refernecs to Imre Nagy and even these were
most gradging. Xitiee It reads almost as if they hated doing it but had no choice in
view of Nagy's having that day called on the UN for recognition of Hungarian
neutrality and announced withdrawal from the &x Warsaw Pacte The boradcast referred
sympathetically to Nagy's desperate appeal fro national unity, but it could not
resist, apparently and unfortwmately, a rehash of Nagy's actions during the past few z
days, In sum the brodcast would have to be chalked up as favorable to the things which
Nagy was then urging on Hungarians (national unity in face of the new Soviet attack)
and unfavorably to Nagye

I don't know what we are supposed to do about the SPD attcak on RPE

but it seems apparent enough that we can not deny it, I believe that hindsight
again is our biggest problem. Nagy is a much greater hero now than he was at any time

before and during the revolution up to the time he was arrested, except for the day

when he reached ‘ommomtityexiey the heights by defying the oncoming Russians and
asking for help. Who is now to judge whether it was
A sincere act of Hungarian patriotism
A bid for western intervention as the only means for preserving
his .power
A bid for western help based on his conviction that western help would be
coming and he would need a position of friendliness to the
rebels
Certainly RFE was right in questioning the motives of a Communist leader,
If RFE did not back off in time and urge Hungarian cooperation with Nagy's
pleas for the restoration of order it may fonm now be called a mistake but I
did not hear any advice to that effect during the events, I assume the SPD
will assert that were it not for RFE the Hungarians would have listened to
Nagy, restored order, and gone on with the sort of position in hand which would
have produced another Poland in Hungary, Maybe that would have happened but
it seems remarkable that not a single one of the 175,000 loose Hungarians have come
up with such a suggestion -- to my knowledge. Everyone says it is too bad that
the Hungarians went beyond the Russian toleration point, and maybe RFE would now
enjoy a better position if it had urged the Hungarians to go easy, but I doubt if the

outcome would have been any different.

As I recall the policy during the time

attack nor support Nagy.
NY, if the summarization for the Kelly Committee is accurate, seems to have advised

Munich to avoid attacks on Nagy and other personalities. Muni did not carry it out,
