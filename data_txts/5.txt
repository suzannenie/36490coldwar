2, There are no political leaders of any importance among the Albanian refn-
gees in Tugoziavia,® The refugees are consequently leoking primarily to
sxiled Albenian leaders in Italy. Yugoslav officials are unfavorable to
the refugee orientation towards leaders in Italy, but they counter this
bias peaceful propaganda only, using no pressure, intimidation, or cen-
sorship.

3. The propaganda leaflets printed by the Committees for Free Albania aroused
a good deal of enthusiasm at first, but the long range effect has been nega~
tive in character since the populace has been discouraged by the failure of
the Comnitiee for Free Albania to carry out the promises contained in the
leaflets,

4. Radio programs criginating in London and Roms are heard in Albanian, The
population, hearing the attacks by BBC against the exiled leaders, has been
embittered since it feels that the exiled leaders should be ecoperating. i*

5. In the Shkeder area, everyone presumes that Zef Pali is serving as Gjon
Markagjoni's representative for the Comittee for Free Albania, since they
are unable to conseive that the Comittee might have excluded Markag joni
fron representetion,

 

Comment: This statement should be treated with reserve since 50X1-HUM
the Yugoslav officials have been ostensibly attempting to build up Nik
Sokolli as a political leader, 50X1-HUM
