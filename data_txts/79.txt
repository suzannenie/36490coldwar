Telephone Conversation with Allen W. Dulles

The Secretary said that on the Russian thing his views, and those of the Department[,] were at
variance with those expressed at Cabinet by Allen and C.D. Jackson. We think it presages a
tougher policy and return to Stalinism. The Secretary said he had gone back to his bible (Problems
of Leninism) and quoted extensively from it to prove his point. Allen did not think that there [were]
comparable men to replace those executed in these days, and felt that the army must have been
with Malenkov. Also he thought, based on the theater party, that this had been decided about 10
days ago and there were new evidences of softness since then, the reforms in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, which sort of upset State's theory.
