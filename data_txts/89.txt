19. Comment on Berlin rioting: The situation in East Berlin has apparently been brought under
control. Soviet troops continue to back up East German police, and numerous arrests have
reportedly been made. Public transportation in East Berlin was still disrupted on 18 June, however,
and Soviet zone traffic into the city irregular. Strict controls over intersector travel have been
imposed.

There are numerous unconfirmed reports of strikes and disturbances in other areas of East
Germany, and martial law has reportedly been extended to some of them.

The government has obviously been frightened by these events and continues to alternate
promises of generous concessions with threats of severe punishment. It is probable that at various
levels the government has been compelled to relinquish authority to the Soviet military
establishment.

American observers in Berlin tentatively attribute the riots to popular suspicion that the recent
conciliatory moves of the East German government were a confession of weakness and that
demonstrations would be dealt with less ruthlessly than in the past.
