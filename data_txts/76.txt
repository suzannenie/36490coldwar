SUBJECT : Implementation of State Department Policy for : |

1. On 5 June 1953, at the meeting between representatives of
‘the Nenartment of State, AMCOMLIB and CIA, the principles governing
were reviewed. The basic policy of attempting to unite the
oviet emigration on a broad basis was reaffirmed.

2. At the same time, the 5R representative made a number of
recommendations for a change in the Committee's implementation of
this basic policy. The principal suggestions were (a) substantially
reduce political subsidies, (b) establish a four or five-man working
staff for the Center, preferably in Paris, (c) separate the operation
of Radio Liberation from the Center both geographically and jurisdictionally., The Chairman of AMCOMLIB opposed these suggestions
(with the possible exception of moving the Center to Paris), and gave
assurance that the steps were unnecessary or undesirable. He expressed :
his personal conviction that the efforts of the Committee along existing “
lines would be successful, although he admitted the possibility of
failure, On the basis of this assurance, CIA granted a three months!
budget at the increased rate requested by Admiral Stevens.

3. Since the basic affirmation of policy was made, the following
major developments have occurred:

a. The Coordinating Center split into a Russian and a
nationality faction, The tensions between these two factions
were sharpened by the existence of a third, the "Peris bloc"

of nationality groups.

b. On 6 June, representatives of the above three factions
met, By mid-June, their negotiations weré stalemated; each
faction proposed changes in the Coordinating Center statutes
unacceptable to the other factions, Meanwhile, the Russian
faction held several private sessions during which it admitted
seven new groups into its rump "Center,"

ce. To break the impasse, AMCOMLIB dispatched its two top
political advisors to Munich. They arrived on 26 June, By
early July, their efforts had failed. yy

d. On 9 July, Admiral Stevens instructed his two emissaries ? wy
to withdraw to Paris, but to return to Munich if developments v
warranted, This maneuver did not alter the situation. One
emissary returned to New York,

above, have in effect been imposed by the course of events: (a) the
elimination of subsidies has been ordered, (b) the "action commission"
in Paris is nroceeding along the lines of the proposed "working staff"
of the Center, (c) Radio Liberation has made steady progress without
active participation by the Center. SR recognized that the Committee
regards this as a temporary situation imposed upon it by the crisis
within the emigration, but still remains of the opinion that its
recommendations were sound as originally presented.

 

6, Chief, SR Division, has conferted | with most of the

 

American Committee's key representatives, and wished to commend them
for the valiant efforts they have made to carry out their difficult
mission,
