MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, 10D |

SUBIECT: ‘Quidanes to Redio Liberation from New York on

Satellite Situation.

1. he attached Telecon conversation between New York ani
Munich giving guidance for treetaent of the satellite situation wes
given me by telephone by Bob Drwhar. Dreher explained thet a meeting
had been held in An@omtdb before the Telecom to arrive at & position,
at which the guidance sent by this branch earlier in the morning bad
been read. The refusal of pexmisesfon for Mmich to brosdeast eny

‘commentary stems directly from Mr, Sargeant, magnified by Mr. Shub.

Mr. Dunham did not dissent.

2. Mr. Sargeant's reasoning, es tranamitted by Mr. Dreher, is
thet the situstion is so fluid and so risky thet Redio Iiberation
must not get into en editorial position at this time. He feels that

at ds essential to avoid giving the listenera on impression of outeide

interference and that RedLib is so identified as an American voice
that its comment could be considered interference. Jurthermore,
Mr. Sargeant is convinced that through the manipulation of news
RadLib can establish ite position just es well or better than by
delivering editorials.

3. Fhe question of distinction batween WOA and Radiib was
reised, and it was pointed out thet Radlib ie not quoting western
comment to any extent, and no U.8. comment, whereas VOA‘'s job is to
give 0.9. reaction. : | |

h. I find myself in cosplete dieagreement with the ben on

commentary. But I do not feel thet { can oppose the Sargeant~Shub~
Dunhes position vith my own opinion, or even that I should. Mey ve
