SUBIECT: RFE Monitoring

| This despatch presents: (1) an evaluation of Radio Free zurope |
programs as to tone, content, and impaet, and (2) a record of

monitoring between January 26 and March 25. The monitoring log

presented at the end of this despatch is divided into two parts and |

reflects the work of two different monitors, one using a Hungarian

Qrion and a Dutch Phillips radio and the other a Hallicrafter. All !

three radios are located in the same building in the Varosliget |

area of Pest. This report was prepared in response to a request

made by RFE for several weeks of intensive monitoring from this

post. The request was made informally to Minister Ravndal during

his recent visit in Munich.

course, they exceed those of VOA. In any "assessment of RFE's role. ;
in the total pieture of American~aponsored broadcasts in Hungarian, :

due consideration should be given to the fact that RFE is doing more

RFE also by its existence alone assures a greater flow of current.
news into Hungary, since at night when RFE, VOA, and various other
West European countries are broaccasting to Hungary, a saturation
condition exists and Hungarian jamming equipment is taxed beyond
ite capacity. In the field of news dissemination, all Western.
broadcasters to Hungary exist in a state of mutual interdependence.
Without RFE broadcasts YOA would probably be compelled to increase
ite number of transmitting stations or be faced with the certainty :
of almost total jamming.

In the field of features, commentaries, etc., RFE runs the
constant risk of being considered merely as a propaganda mouthpiece
that has little relation to diplomacy or to the exigencies of international politics. There is a feeling among some Hungarians

(especially the more intelligent) that RFE has promised a "pie in
the sky" and now there is no one to deliver. In the long run the
life expectancy of RFE may depend on its ability to develop agreater sensitivity to the changing international scenes. Hunga~
rians in the past have been notoriously bad propagandists. Hungarian propaganda between World: Ware I and II, for example, was
dominated by a revisionist obsession which was unsubtly displayed
for the entire world to see. The RFE Hungarian section has a
tendency to show a similar inflexibility and lack of subtlety.

The weakness deseribed above is probably still a source of

some present strength. The popularit} of RFE among Hungarians is
considerable, and this pdpilarity séems_i 1ereasa as ong - ‘genes
ToT ié educations oF: RFE, very likely much more than VOA,
|| Synibo zes to the Hungs Lan people the -wetive-interest of the ~
United otates lovernne in Hungary and Hungarians, The danger

Ws that the symbol is : Static one in that RFE still seems to
symbolize to Hungarians future Western liberation of their country.

RFE in order to survive must face up to the problem of transforming

itself into a symbol not of future Western liberation but of
Western concern that Hungarians stubbornly wrest concession after
concession from their government.

In specific substantive matters, the commentators Ulysses and
Notarius seem to enjoy a great deal of popularity. Likewise the
program "In the Farmer's Garden" seems to be well received. The

music programs, it can be gaid almost with certainty, are highly |
popular. Likewise, imitations of such American radio entertainment
as Double or Nothing are probably geod for audience attraction;
perhaps greater care should be taken, however, to keep such programs more on the entertainment than the propaganda level. The
Lampooning of Hungarian Communist leaders is undoubtedly a good
device, but greater care should be taken to keep from going to
extremes or of lapsing into banal "cuteness." In all these feature
programs, it should be noted, RFE has the knack of "talking the
Language" of the Hungarian people to a much greater degree than

VOA. The overall detail knowledge which | tly shows about |

Although the feature programs of RFE frequently reveal a
considerable background of research and knowledge, the long broad~
casting hours of RFE inevitably lead to a large number of fill-in

programs

programs with little intrinsie or propagandistic value. For this
reason, it is suggested that RFE might consider a "Point Four
Program of the Air” in the educational field, An article in the
February, 1956 issue of Fapsadalmt S e (Social Review), en~ :
titled "The Situation and Tasks of the- Sei ence of Marxist Pedagozy,."
after admitting shortcomings in’ Marxist teaching in Hungarian
schools, comes to the following conclusions:

"In the light of the November Resolution of the Central
Leadership and its reselution to the improvement of educational work, pedagogical research ought to be concentrated
on the following topics:

a) the communist ideological-political education of
our youth,

b) contents and methods of training and educational
work,

ce) contents and methods of polytechnical education in
our schools,

d) educational work of the youth organizations carried
out at school,

Research work is to be directed as soon as possible
toward the communist education of Hungarian youth at large."

It is suggested that RFE might answer this projected Marxist
offensive in the educational field by a regular "school of the air"
program which would feature lectures on basic American institutions
and perhaps even suggest research topics for Hungarian youth to
carry on in their public and school libraries. One of the drafters
of this despatch had a talk with Mr. Bartok. of IBS last autumn
abeut this type of a project in connection with VOA. However, it
is the Legation's belief that this type of a program could best be
carried out by RFE.

In relation to a program of the type described above, RFE
should probably also give serious consideration to the feasibility
of producing an English-language teaching program on the order of
the type of teaching the BBC has been carrying on so successfully
in various European areas for many years. (Incidentally, the BBC
English-language teaching program for Hungary was discontinued
about five years ago.) That there is a strong desire among Hungarians to learn English is confirmed by every impression of this
Legation's officers, This desire 1s probably all the greater

because it is suppressed. The Legation feels strongly that an
RFE English-language achool of the air would enjoy considerable
popularity and would unquestionably stir far. greater interest
than the Russian-language teaching programs sponsored by the
Magyar Radio. It should be noted that USIA could supply the
necessary teaching materials, thus obviating any need for RFE
to undertake a costly and time-consuming preparatory effort.
The tone of such a program should be informally academic with |
no attempt to introduce propaganda-loaded sentences. The amount
of information about life beyond the Iron Curtain which would
fit easily and naturally into a language-teaching program would
constitute its "propaganda payload."

The Legation wishes to draw attention to the fact that by
introducing "school of the air" programs into its broadcasts,
RFE would take a silent step toward transforming the symbol which
it currently constitutes for the Hungarian people.

The following logs show a considerable amount of reception
difficulty at least in the Budapest area. In all probability
this difficulty is smaller in the provinces. It should alse be
noted that several local employees who listen to RFE programs
in the Legation building have been able to hear mid-morning news

' broadcasts almost every day on the 16, 19, and 25 meter bands.
