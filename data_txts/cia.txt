1. membere of the Albanian Legation 25X11
in Belgrade made a direct appeal to a group of Albanian refugees for
voluntary repatriation. The appeal was made at a UDB (Yugoslav 1.8.)
sponsored meeting held in Nikeic, Yugoslavia. Albanian refugees in
Niksic and ase far away as Titograd were compelled to attend the meeting.

2. One of the Albanian officials addreased the meeting, in the presence
of the UDB officers, on the progress made in Albania under the Communist
regime. He stated that it wes a great mistake for Albanians to have.
ebandoned their fatherland and urged them to return. At this point
the UDB officers applauded the speaker while the Albanian refugees
shouted in unigon; "West!" Hearing thie, the Albanian official replied;
"Thoge who are for Socialiem can remain in Yugoslavia because ve
{Rivania and Yugoslavis/ are friends." Once again the refugees
shouted; "Weet!" Tue Albanian official retorted with the question:
"Which Weet? The NOFA? The United States? Great Britain? Wherever
you go you will only be there for a short time because victory
belongs to the Boviet Union and then once again you will be in our
hands - you can't escape. We will give you an example of the degeneration of the Weat. The Yugoslav authorities have given you exit permite,
you have gone to the embassies of the western couutries for entry permits
and they have not honored your request. If you had money, they would
have opened their doors. Their God is money."

 

3. At this point the refugees began exposing their bodies to ehow the
burns and scars which they received when tortured by the police in
Albania, and saying: "It is true that Yugoslavia bas supported us;
but we have paid for this because half of our byothers have been
lost, therefore there is only the West for us."

-2.
The Albanian officials began making derogatory remarks about the United
States, the NCFA, ex-King Zog, Hasan Dosti, Abas Kupi, Abas Ermenji

and other refugee leaders. The refugees shouted; “Long live the
United States who supports the NCFA and will liberate Albania."

They rushed to where the Albanian officiels were standing and began
attacking them. The UDB officers moved in to protect the Albanian
officials, but they too were beaten and bed several chairs broken on
their heada.. In the midat of thia fracas, one of the Albanian officials,
remembering an old Albanian custom which signifies humiliation before
an overwhelming force shouted: "We ure in your hande 0 albanians,”
Hesring thie, the refugees stopped hitting the officials and left the
building.

The Yugoslav authorities took disciplinary measures against the
refugees. Some were fined & ~- 15 thousand dinars while others were
put in jedi.

The Albanian officiale hed held similar meetings in Podujevo and

in other Albanian refugee centera but without incident. No Albanian
refugees has requested repatriation to Albania. All want to join
the West.
