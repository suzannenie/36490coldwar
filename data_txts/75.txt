1. Disturbances are reported to have occurred on 2 August 1953 in the following localities:
Rangsdorf, Falkensee, Velten, Potsdam and Babelsberg, Nauen, Luckenwalde, Juterbog, Gotha,
So√©mmerda, Radebeul, Elsterwerda, Riesa, and Dessau. Sporadic shooting is reported from
Chemnitz, Potsdam and Babelsberg, Bitterfeld, and Falkensee. The situation was quieter on 3
August, presumably as a result of the barring of the railroad stations. There was increased unrest
in Leipzig and Magdeburg on 4 August. Tension was lessened on 5 August by the renewal of the
sale of railroad tickets to Berlin from most areas except Saxony and Mecklenburg.

2. The Soviet garrison in Leipzig is continuing its normal functions, and is not assigned to the duty
of quelling disturbances. The KVP has been observed in strength in Cottbus, Neustrelitz,
Oranienburg, Bitterfeld, Leipzig, and Magdeburg.

3. Workers at the Buna plant demanded permission to go to Berlin to pick up food packages; when
this was refused, they staged a slow-down on the afternoon and night of 3 August. It is reported
without confirmation that a similar incident took place at the Leuna works. The Buna plant was
occupied by about 10 or 20 Soviet tanks beginning at 3:00 on 3 August.

4. There are no indications at present of an intention to seal the sector borders again in Berlin.
