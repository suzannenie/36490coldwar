Officers and men of the group of occupation forces! You have been sent to suppress German
workers who have rebelled. Return to the barracks and tell your comrades how the workers are
fighting for their rights. The revolt of the Berlin workers and their courage should serve as an
example for the Soviet Army. [...]

Wives of Soviet officers and soldiers, tell your husbands, Soviet officers, and men what you are
learning from German friends, neighbors, cleaning women, drivers, and apartment owners. Show
local residents that your sympathies are on the side of the workers who have rebelled and are
striking. Tell them that our people deeply sympathize with their brave struggle.

A new radio station is on the air, the radio station of the coordinating center of the anti-Bolshevik
struggle is on the air. Listen to Liberation Radio.
