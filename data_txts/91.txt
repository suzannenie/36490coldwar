Berlin police. HICOG, CIC and DAD have no (repeat no) Knowledge of him.

over to West Berlin police this afternoon. Police say they have good case against Nuschke re
disappearance his former secretary except for lone link. Details unknown.

Soviet tanks and armored cars stationed at crucial points in East Berlin. No (repeat no) action
reported, all quiet. VOPO machine guns emplaced some traffic points especially crossovers to
West Berlin. Inner city completely controlled by troops and police. Soviet CDT allegedly gave
orders no (repeat no) one may leave or enter Soviet sector. This appears probable. Traffic at
standstill.

Unconfirmed reports state strikes, work slow downs continue at Hennigsdorf Steel Plant and some
other points in zone around Berlin.

No (repeat no) clear picture developments in zone at large, but have unconfirmed reports [of]
unrest and strikes in Dresden, Magdeburg, Halle, Erfurt, Leipzig, Brandenburg, Torgau, Chemnitz,
Zwickau and Bitterfeld. Judging by East German radio, which emphasizes quiet in Berlin, unrest
outside Berlin likely, but [it is] impossible [to] evaluate extent.
