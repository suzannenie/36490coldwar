SUBJECT: Radio Broadcasts to the Soviet Union Supported by the American
Comnittes for the Idberation of the Peoples of Russis~Sone
Basic Policy Considerations

 

le The overall objective, for the immediate future, of the radio
brosdeasta to the Soviet Union eupported by the American Committee for
the Liberation of the Peoples of Rusia should be to deepen and widen
the gulf between the peoples of the Soviet Union and their Ccmsmuniat
rulers. With this end in view, the broadcasts ahould seek to incresse
the atrese and strain and the tensions whieh exist in the Soviet Union
and sow the seede of dissaffection where it does not now exiet. There
ia no question but that disseffeation exists on a wide saale in. the
Soviet Union in varying degrees, ranging from inoipient diasatiafaction
with existing conditions and doubte as to the realization of Communist
ideals, lack of sympa with pregent policies of the Kremlin, etc, to
complete disillusgionnent and flerce hatred of the CGoamuniat regine.
The peoplea of the Soviet Union are potentially valuable allies of the
Free World and it is in the interest of the Free World to integrate their
opposition to their Uoammist aleve, hovever passive and unimportant such
opposition may be at present, into world-wide struggle of the Western
Demeracios against the Kremlin, Oocnsequentiy, it is essential to
enoouvage in the Soviet Union the apirit of resistance to exploitation
and oppression, to fortify anti-Comminist sentiments, to bring home to
the peoples of the Soviet Union that they have {riends in the Free World,
and to develop among then a sympathetic attitude toward the Western
Denoeracies, Every effort should be made to reduce to a minimus the
collaboration of the population of the Soviet Union with the Communist
Goverment and to develop an attitude of non-cooperation and syeh
obstructionian end passive resistance as will not entail punishment
of participents, The ommiative effect of unorganised miscallenscis
non-sooperation ean be very great in that it not only causes material
damage to the funetioning of the governmental machinery but also depresses
the morale of the commnist rulers end makes more diffioult their work
while enecuraging the spirit cf resistance of the population, It is
hardiy necessary to emphasise that the development in considerable segnents
of the pop ation of the Soviet Union of an attitude of sullen resentnent
and shrewd non-ooopersation with the communist authorities will redound to
the great advantage of the Free World, both during the cold war as wll
as in the event of armed conflict,

 

2, The propagandising of the population of the Soviet Union against
the communist government is work which oan be effectively accomplished
only by reprecentacives of the peoples of the Soviet Union, serving solely

the interests of the Soviet peoples and understanding and responding to

their sentiments and agpiretions. The necessary leadership of this work
wast be found among representatives of the peoples of the Soviet Union
who enjoy freedom abroad, A Politioal Center quelified to asewne leader
ehip of the struggle of the peoples of the Soviet Union against their
qommniet rulers is now in the process of organization. In the event
that the Folitieal Center is not established pricr to the {nauguration
of radio broadcasts, the broadoasts should be made in the name of the
Commission set up to organise the Political Center or of a Committee
appointed by that body, In any event it is of paramount importance that
the oyganisation in whose name brondeasts are made to the Soviet Union |
4g a genuine creation of the Soviet emigration-enct a foreign agency
a Rusaian group set up as a stooge by a foreign power, In thig sonnedtion
3% ip essential that the relations between the Political Center and its
aativities and the American Ocmmlttee be placed on a basis appropriate

to the role to be played by the Political Center, The function of the
American Comittee is (1) to assist the Soviet refugees, to create an
effeetive organisation of leadership, as the Committee has been doing,
and (2) to make available to thes means, radio facilities, sta, wereby they can commanicate vith their fellow oountrymen behind iron
Gartain, The relationship, therefore, should be that existing between
allies, between partners, who are asecciated in a common enterprise.

The Politics! Center should never be treated as an agent of the American
Committees and every effort must be made to avoid taking any astion, or
waking any statement, which implies that the Political Center and its
astivities are st ste to the American Committee,

 

3e The Political Genter will ulre considerable assistance in
inaugurating radio proadoasts to the et Union, While affording
agsistance to the organization of the broadcaste, it should be the
endeavor of the American Committee to bulld up in the Folitisal Center
a gemiuine Rugsian organization qualified to carry on the broadcasts
without any participation of the Americen Committee other than that
involved in the axtension of assistance and in the supervision of the
observance of certain general principles laid down by the American
Committee, such ag that the broadvaste will not be utilised to propagate
the political dvoteyines of any particular party; that they will not
inglude material tending to provoke cvert action against the Soviet
Government, ete, In this connsotion the seleetion of the Russian who
will have chayvge of the broadoasts is of primary importance, ‘The appoint~
ment to thie post of a gapahie individual, in complete sympathy with the
purposes of the American Committee, will prealude the development of
delicate problems and gontroversies which vill inevitably ariae if, as
the reault of the incapacity of the Ruseian director, the American
supervisor is forded to play a direeting role rather than an advisory

one in the preparation of the broadcastea,

4o It in important that the Americans associated with the radio
activities clearly understand the basia character of the broadcasts in
order that the broadeasta oan render the greatest service to the struggle
of the Western Democracies against Bolsheviam and that there may be xo
duplication of, or competition with, the broadcasts of YOA, The broad~
Oaste to the Soviet Union supported by the American Committee are to be
Russian breedcasts-——-not American broadcasts; they are to serve the
interests of the Russian liberation movement—-not the interests of the
United States," Gonsequently, they will not explain or defend American
policies, propagate Amerloan ideas, extol the American yay of life, build
up American prestige, play American jass, or otherwise encroach upon the
field of activity of VOA, Thay will not partake in any way of American
broadcasta. The radio of the American Comittee is to be an organ, et
of the people. of the United States, but of the peopleof the Soviet
Union, a8 represented by a group of Soviet refiigees who have assoolated
themselves to asaiat the struggle of their fellow countrymen against
Communis$ oppression.

5. With yegard to the contenta of the bycadcasts, which will be
direeted in the beginning primarily to the Soviet armed forces and the
Soviet civilian personnel in the ogeupied zones of Germany and Austyis
and the satellite countries, 1% should be borne in mind that a Soviet
eitisen will rigk his liberty and possibly his life tn listening to these
broadcasts, Gonaequently, it is important that the contents of the broadq
casta be such ag to justify his taking this risk, The radio programs.
ahould be carefully worked out with a view to the attainment of certain
definite objeotives; every item should serve a definite purpose. Every
effort should be made to build up the credibility and authority of ths
radio so that the broadeasts will exercise the greatest possible influence
in the Soviet Union, The following are some of the major objeatives whioh
we should pursue in aelesting material to be inaluded in the broadcasts:

: (a) The deatrustion of the Soviet government's monopoly of
information whieh 1a one of the bases, prohably the most vulnerable,
of the Oommunist power. As several radio emissions to the Soviet
Union are aotive in thig field, it would seem advisable for the
radio of the Political Senta cit nfine itself to the dissemination
of news items of the greates ‘bo ‘the: Soviet publio as a result of
the news being ignored by Soviet information media or presented by
them in a distorted fashion, Particular cere should be taken in
preparing news broadcastea not to inolude iteme which are of no
interest to the population of the Soviet Union,

*Of course, indireotiy the broadeasts will serve American interests to a
very high degree because the strengthening of the opposition of the pecples
of the Soviet Union to their comminist rulers and the consequent weakening
of the Soviet State will strengthen the forces of the Free World struggling
against International Communian,
C05459033

 

(b) The destruction of the Soviet government's monopoly
of intellestual education and guidance, Political and esoncmis
developments should be presented and explained in suob manner os
to make readily apparent fallacies of camunist ldeclogy. A
tematie effort should be made to refute the bagic tenets of
au~Leniniam, It 4e believed that ea well conceived radio
program slong these lines wuld heve very fruitful results, |

(9) The destruction of the myth of the inevitable victory
of Comaian, Rvery effort should be made to gormvince Soviet
aitisens of the moral and material s opity of the Free
World over the Communist system, of iInvinsibility of the
Yree World and the inevitability of its viatory over Communist

tem. News items should be selected to impreas Soviet

listeners with the great strength of the Free Wrld, its
material resources, solentifio achievements, economic progress,
ote., with the steps teken by the Weatern Democracies to build
up thelr economia and military strength, eto, Propaganda
along thie line ig of great importance in view of the tremendous
and unremitting efforts of the Kremlin to inculcate the idea
of the miperiority of the Ccmmimist system and the inevitability
of ite extension over the whole werld. There is no question but
that the morale of opposition elements would be greatly strengthened
by the destruction of the myth of the inevitability of the victory
of Communi am.

(2) An important objective should be to sonvinoe the pecples
of the Soviet Union that they do not stand elone in their
oppesition to Communist tyranny and that they have friends in the
West who underatand their sltuation and sympathize with thes in
theiy aufferings: that the Western Demcoracies have only the
friendliest feelings for the peoples of the Soviet Union vhom
they regerd as their allies in the styucgis against the Communist
dietstorship in the Kremliny that the Democratic Nations heve no
aime prejudicial to the interests of the peoplea of the Soviet
Dnion and that they have no intention of interfering in the
internal affairs of the Soviet Union which are to be settled by
the Soviet pecples themselves. In gormnestion with this objective
of winning the peoples of the Soviet Unicn as allies of the est,
an effort should be made to demolish the myth created by the
Kremlin that the Communist movement is a champion cf world peace,
Sinoe the masses of the population of the Soviet Union are
sincerely in favor of pesce, their support should be sought by
denonstrating to them that the Kremlin's aims and policies lead to
war and that western political ocnoepts and methods offer the only
hope of working toward an international order whieh ean bring
about real peace after the overthrow of Bolshevism,

(oe) Gongideration should be sivern to the inelusion of
material caloulated to encourage defeotion as soon as
appropriate arrangements have been made for the resaption
and handling of refugess in accordance with the principles
of fveedon and dignity espoused by the Western Democracies.
Thes@ arrangements should cover reorientation, reset? lenent
and opportunity to participate in anti-Oomminist work, It
should be borne in mind that the prestige of the Political
Center would be gravely impaired if ita radio specifically
ensourages defection and those who respond are not well treated.

(2) Bpeoial progrens should be worked out for the various
groups reached by the brosdcasts, such as arny officers, soldiers,
technieians, scientists, eto. In the sase of the soientiate,
for inutance, of whom there are undoubtedly many in the Soviet
eivil and military administrations in the occupied areas, the
special program should contain information on seientifie
activities ebroad denied to Soviet solentists by their government,
in particular, data concerning the experimental verification of
soientifia theories whieh imply the unscundness of basio tenets
of the official ideology of the Kremlin, the discussion of secientifie
pringiples and trends, the logical development of which voulks

ponfliet with Merxism-Leninimn, ete, The ground for the @efi
of Soviet scientists oan be laid by Soviet emigre seientists
A4iselosing the conditions of freedom in whieh scientific work is
carried on abroad,

  

(g) The broedeasts should contain carefully seleoted items of
information @nd enigre life and developments in the Soviet
emigration, espeoially on emigre anti-eommunist activities and
astivities in defense of the interests of the peoples of the
Soviet Union, When the Political Genter is established every
effort should be made to build up the prestige of the Center in
order that it may enj:y the greatest authority in the Soviet
Union,

(h) As the broadoasta are Russien brvadcasts, 1% is important
that all material be presented from the point of view of the
peoples of the Soviet Union. Items which might affront, estrange .
op antagonize any of the peoples of the Soviet Union must be
excluded, It would seem advisable to develop prograns designed
to remind the peoples of the Soviet Union of episodes in their
history whieh most vividly depict thelr opposition to politieal,
cultural and spiritual oppression. Such provrams would tend to
strengthen the morale of the Soviet pecples, but they vould have
to be worked out with the greatest oare in order tc avoid giving
offense to the sentiments of any national group,
