In Bad Godesberg (alone) after returning from two weeks trip to U.S.A. including hearings on
budget before House Committee and public hearing before Senate appropriations committee with
McCarthy chief prosecutor. Also return from Berlin & Paris. Berlin demonstrations in East Sector
add complications to Russiansâ€™ sudden turn to a soft policy!

As to the Russians, the question is how will they get out of their troubles in the East Zone.
Unification on their terms is no longer even a good propaganda line. Query whether some proposal
from the Allies on Berlin or the border would throw them still further off balance. | am inclined to
think so. But would the French and British go along?
