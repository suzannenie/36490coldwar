Top Secret

New York (Voice of America in Russian, 17:15, 25 June, official transcript)

New York. The radio station Liberation, which is under the control of the coordinating center of
Russian anti-Communist organizations to fight Bolshevism, turned to Soviet occupation troops in
East Germany in connection with the worker unrest in the Soviet zone of Germany.

Under the general heading of “What is to be done?,” the radio station Liberation turned to Soviet
occupation troops with the following appeals:

“Officers and men of the Group of Forces! The demands of the Berlin workers are also the
demands of our workers. Their struggle is our struggle. The Berlin workers have acted against a
dictatorship in the name of all enslaved peoples, including our people. Don’t shoot at the workers!
Show Berliners that we are on their side, that you are not gendarmes but brothers in a common
struggle for workers’ rights.

Soviet patrols in Berlin! Show that you are on the side of the workers when patrolling the streets of
Berlin. Fraternization with the workers of Berlin will convince the whole world that the Soviet Army
and our people are against the Communist dictatorship. In case of danger, go to the Western
sectors. Crossing over to the West, a refusal to act against workers will show the whole world on
whose side the Soviet Army and our people are. Together with the workers of Berlin you will
become an example for Soviet troops and for our people among us in the Motherland.”
