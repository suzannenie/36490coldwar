Would appreciate full report [of] your implementation of Infoguide Bulletins concerning East Berlin
demonstrations. We believe this presents excellent propaganda opportunity and singular chance to
work cooperatively with West German Government and SPD. In addition to steps already taken
(instruction to information media and Conant statement) we are hoping to be able have President
announce new grants to West Berlin economic programs (UR TOMUS 747) with appropriate
statement regarding situation in East Berlin. Therefore suggest you do not make release this item
until after Presidential statement.
