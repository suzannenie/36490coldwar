Secret Security Information

From: Bonn
To: Secretary of State
No: 582, August 8, 2.00 p.m.

Sent Department 582, Repeated Information Berlin 125.

We are in general agreement Berlin's thoughtful analysis SED policy (Berlin 211 to Bonn, repeated
Department 188, August 6) and the conclusions. From principal conclusion, namely that any
uprisings workers would be ruthlessly put down, it follows, we believe, that US policies toward East
Germany while aimed at encouraging and keeping alive the intensified spirit of resistance
awakened in mid-June should still carefully avoid and if necessary endeavor to restrain East Zone
resistance from taking such overt forms as would give Communist authorities excuse for brutal and
bloody repressions of population and particularly their leaders. As long as western world believe
such freedom brought into sight by recent events, US propaganda and other initiatives (essential
and timely though they are) must continue [to] be governed by restraint. Otherwise smoldering fire
[of] East German resistance may be prematurely fanned up and stamped out; and the fetters of
Communism tightened again and Communist propagandists given opportunity to fasten
responsibility upon USA.
