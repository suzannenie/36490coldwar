the text now rests with the Department of State, It is my understanding

conservative suggestion in the covering memorandum of PSB De26, namely,
eeoe'it be worked into an early speech, by the Secretary of State for
example, in order to provide current psychological operations in
Eastern Burope with needed support without implying any more ambitious

programs there." I recommend that the operating agencies concerned

be informed accordingly,

SED_ PRINCETON STA

/ American foreign policy seeks to attain these goals:
the defense of the United States, the creation and maintenance of
a structure of world peace in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations, the development of conditions in which peoples
may freely establish the governments and institutions under which
they live._/ |

In the War against Nazism the United States and Great Britain,
and the Soviet on as well, pledged themselves to the principle
that the countries liberated from Nazi despotism should enjoy the
right to governments of their own choice. The Soviet Union has —
made a mockeyyof this pledge and ruthlessly prevented the peoples
of Central and Eastern Europe from exercising this right,

We share with these peoples the common interest that no single
power shall again dominate Europe, destroying their national existence and threatening our own, The constantly reiterated desire of
the U. S, Government is to see political independence re-established .
in those countries within a framework which will sustain the peace,

It is our belief that this goal can be attained without resort
to war. The American people will never lose interest in other
people who want to be free, and we propose ——

To continue to strive, together with others, for the establishe
ment of cooperation among the European countries for economic
welfere and common security, |

To support the entrance of the countries of Central and Eastern
Europe now under Soviet domination, as equal members. into this
family of friendly nations, as soon as their national Mberties
are restored,

To strive for a democratic unification of Germany in order that
a Germany thus unified may become a constructive member of the
family of free European countries, cooperating with its
neighbors in the progress of economic advancement and common
security,

To link our actions to these ends with continuing efforts
to achieve effective worldewide reduction and control of
armaments to which these developments in Europe would give
powerful support,

it is the clear lesson of this century that men cannot live
in peace and freedom when Europe is threatened by the domination
of a single power, All history teaches that no nation, however
powerful and whatever the ambitions of its rulers, can render
itself secure by attempts to impose its will upon other nations,

Given effective world-wide security arrangements, our objectives
can in no way threaten the Russian national interest. On the
contrary, the Russian people are now denied security the
policies of: the Soviet. Regime, and only a change to policies of
peaceful collaboration and respect for other countries wi

permit the vast resources of Russia to be devoted to the welfare
of the Russian peoples who could, if permitted to do so, make

a great contribution to the welfare of the world,

goal is peso with freedom for the peoples of many lands,
We have” ne thought of urging our cutural, social, economic or
political patterns on any country, We respect the cultural
traditions of each nation as that nation's most precious heritage,
We recognize that each nation must be free to organize the forms
of its national life, limited only by the common requirements of
world peace, . Only thus will the deep spiritual, social, a

economic aspirations of men find progressive fulfiliment.
