Mr. Barrett said that he reit At was most important for us to get a
news and ideas to the psople in Eastern buropa. My. Kohler added that —
two radio voloes-- VOA and -RFEee are worse then one when they ary not |
oloarly distinguishvble by the atdience, Mr. wiagaor acid if we needed
more voluna to astern Lurope we. should stop up the Voice of Americae

ur. Barrett recalled tho fact thot Mr. Kohler fsele that thers
is nothing that nosds to be gaic to tho| i shat onnnot be said
quite adequately by the Voice of American Mr. Dulles raised the quese”
tion of how the | plans of RFE could be called off. if it is
decided not to put the programs on the aire ro Kohler said that in
his talke with John Hughes and Adolph Borle he had the cefinite ims
pression that the pursonnel which had ‘so far baun lined up for the progrim sould be taken care of in other ways, He said it
wou e better to have a headache for a couplo of weeks than to live
with the problem for a couple of yearae Mr. Dullas pointed out that a
a responsible group of Amerioan citizens had particLpated in the planning
: for this and other Hit activitios and that they and their proposale .—
sould not juyt be casually dicutesed. xr. Wisnar said he felt. that
@ perfectly logical explanation cculd be advanced, that political oon]
ditions have chenged and that the State Gepartinzat 1a now able to carry
on the | jobs therefore, E's resources could be epplied in other
directiono. ire Barrett rcoallwd that the requzst from the State . x
Department for tho[ — |broadcast by luk hed como at o time mhen
State did not have the finanoial rescurgss to undertake such programs.
Mr. Kohler said that the progran need had first come to his
atiention in the winter of 1919-50. Mr. Dulles remtrdad the group _
that in biay, 1951 the Department of State had approved RFE broadcasts Hf

generally egreed that in spite of theée oomltments yonéitidnes had

in New York with RPE rcprysontatives to help them take the heat off Rik
