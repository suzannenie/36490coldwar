Estonia, latvia ani Lithuania into the USGR, We continus to recognize
am to deal with the Baltio diplomtic and consular representatives in
this country who served the last indepenient governments of those States
peice to Soviet occumtion in Jume 1940, The Governnent of the USSR, on
the other hani, considers the Ustonian, latvian ami Lithuanian so-called
Soviet Sceialist Republics to be 3 of the 16 constituent Republics which
make up the USSR,

The position of the U with respect to Soviet incorporation was first
enunciated on July 23, 1940 (see Annex B) and has been repeatedly stated
thereafter, 4 recent statement was that of the Secretary on November 30,
1953 (soo Annex C) before the Select House Comittee to Investigate ani
ap Bega of Litimanta, Jutvia and Estonia by the USSR, in which

ts

"The captive peoples should know that they ere not
forgotten, that we are not reconciled to their fate,
ami, above all, that we are not promred to seek
iDusery safety for ourselves by a bargain with their
masters which would confirm their captivity,"

-- ~ Thte statemont made in anticiption of the Bermda mocting of
Decerber 1953 ani the Berlin Conference of February 1954 also included
the declaration thats a,

"io do not lock upon the conference table as a place .
where wo surrender cur principles, but rather as a ,
place for making our principles prevail,"

Particular American principles to which reference was made earlier
an the Secretary's atatement wero thoge expressed in the Atlantic Charter
relating to cur wish "to see sovereign rights and self-governuent restored
to these who have forcibly been deprived of then,"

' In further exposition of these considerations, it is noted that the

In franker moments the USSR has iniicated that possession of the Baltic
States was deomed advantageous to the Soviet power position vis-a-vis Germury
