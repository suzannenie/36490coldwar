While in New York the mexbors of the Committees presented
themselves to the Albanians there as a united group ,
together for a common cause parallel to that of other s
national groups composed of Bulgarians, Hungarians and
Rumeanians, flowever, the real relationship among them is
one of diffidence; thus far no serious problems heve arisen
to put their spirit of cooperation and sincerity te a real
teat.

Kupl, Kotta, Eryeziu and Pali all stated that they hed been
promised by American officials that they would have an
Albanian language broadcast and a weekly publication in
Albanian. This broadcast was not to be transmitted over
the Voice of America but by a private network, probably the
RBC. Abas Kupi and fuci Kotta anticipated a clash when the
time came to choose the personnel for the paper and the
broadcasts they thought that the Halld Kombetar would try
to put their own people in these posts, and Abas Kupi
feared that the American and Sritish authorities would
give preference to meabers of the Balli Kombetar, whieh

he felt had already been favored rhen sixty members of that
group had been recruited to receive training on Malte.

Midhat Frasheri did not receive a warm welcome from members
of his own party and fran other groupe of Albanians whom he-
had hoped to win over to his side, In addition te the

between him and 'lassan Desti reported abeve, there was

incident which would even to indicate a certain lack of pree-

come. bert later in the Gy thal they would be wuable to
of the Balli Nombetar and that he ie trying to form a new
