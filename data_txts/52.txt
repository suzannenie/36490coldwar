Top Secret

Information Bulletin no. 4/1955
Reference: Letters Addressed to RFE Cover Addresses

In the period between January 1 and March 1, 1955, department IX confiscated 391 letters sent
from various places in Poland to 35 cover addresses in England, France, Sweden, West Germany,
Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and Switzerland.

Among the total number of letters were:
— anonymous with hostile content — 230
— hostile content with a sender — 7

— containing various requests regarding searches [for persons], passing on greetings, and
establishing contacts — 154

Among the anonymous letters were 11 messages about the provocateur Swiatlo, based on
listening to RFE broadcasts or [reading] brochures distributed by balloon.

A writer from todz, saying he is a railroad worker: “[VOA] recently broadcast the revelations of
Jézef Swiatto. They should broadcast the entire series of programs, as RFE has done. What a
sensation Swiatto is for Poles. We are greatly indebted to [him] for the revelations, which are
historic, and which are on everyone’s lips. He has openly taught our rulers a good lesson, showing
their true faces to Polish society...”

[More excerpts from letters about Swiatto follow. ]
Many of the anonymous letters with a markedly hostile content, some 17%, were written by young
people. Many of them seek contact and instructions for opposing the existing system in Poland, or

for assistance in leaving Poland. [...]

Other letters are about the programs of Radio Free Europe. They demonstrate the weakness of the
ideological struggle and the need for heightened efforts in that direction. [...]

All letters have been transferred to department III and section III of the security service in order to
identify and take action against the senders.
