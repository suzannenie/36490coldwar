sie assumption
that additional and meaningful mea
sures will be instated to insure uniform implementation of agreed-upon
policy. As I am sure you know, we are as anxious as you amd others
interested to guarantee that our facilities are usefully engaged in
support of United States objectives, and that the margin for error in
this regard is diminished to vanishing point,

Recent developments, both of positive nature with regard to
what we have learned of the great impact and influence of the Fund's
broadcasting, as well as negatively in respect to certain broadcasts

in the Hungarian language which have drawn criticism, demand that policy

lines be followed rigorously and assiduously.

To achieve this end it

is our firm determination; likewise it is our conviction that the indigenous tone and authentic character of our programs, which have been

such important factors in building up audience rapport and extensive

listenership among the satellite peoples, be maintained and enhanced,
Therefore, the manner in which we seek to achieve desired policy ends

is of itself of great importance,

We intend to set up and put in

motion new measures which would be practically workable in this regard.

At the Fund President's behest, a detailed plan will be presented to

him at early date,

Our thinking at the present time indicates that fundamental
to implementation of policy on a firm basis is a clear, single chain

of command from the Fund President to the broadcasting Director, to
his chief operating personnel, with "policy" transmitted through that

chain; a direct line of responsibility for content from the officer~incharge of the desks (the American Program Director) to the desk chiefs;
and holding desk chiefs wholly answerable in the first instance for the

output of the vari

ous voices,

Policy control mechanisms now in force would be strengthened
through more complete pre-broadcast review of political content, through
fuller discussion by exile writers of commentary and other program outlines with the Political Advisar in Munich, in concert with designated

Program Department staff.

be necessary in order to fulfill this objective.

Current post-broadcast reviews would continue but with the
understanding of all concerned that professional incompetence or wilfull
policy violation would be subject to disciplinary action involving sus-~pension or dismissal of the offending individuals,

Successful working of this combination of pre-broadcast-content
sorutiny and post-review presupposes two fundamental factors:

(1) Clear understanding and agreement of what policy is on the
part of American supervisors, and an equally clear com~
munication of these policies on a continuing basis by the
Policy Advisor to the exile staff, and

(2) Competent and trustworthy exile staffs, working under desk
chiefs with both authority to direct operations and responsibility far content,

Unless the practice which has been in effect over a number of
years were to be changed drastically, one must ensure that genuine re-~
sponsibility be given to exiles of the countries concerned, working on
a full two-way partnership with American colleagues, We feel we are well
advised in giving competent exile supervisors a maximm measure of our
trust if we hope to secure from and through them the kind of ideas, resourcefulness and judgment which will make our programs worth listening to.
Were we to impose a systen of American pre-broadcast political seript
review, we could reach a point where the desk chiefs could not direct
their own staffs when these exile subordinates know that orders given
are subject to eventual over~call by another line of command, We feel
it wuld be undesirable to have American-directed exile staffs, without
seriously abridging mutual trust and working partnership; since it
would be all but impossible to find responsible "American" Americans who
at the same time are capable of thinking as Poles, Hungarians, Czechoslovakians, etc., there would be only one possible further step, the introduction of English master soripts put into other languages by translation
staffs.

The foregoing treats with points 1 and 2 of your reference letter,
With regard to point 3, steps already have been taken toreduce sharply
the ‘volume of political commentary and desk editorializing. We are present ly, with reference to point h, working out a system which should pro~
vide a daily teletype summary review of guidance on political subjects
passed on to the exile desks by the Policy Advisor. Some manpower and
technical problems remain to be worked out on the latter subject.

As you may know, pre~broadeast content review similar to that
held in Munich before broadcasts has been instituted on a regular basis
in New York within the Program Department,

Please be reassured that our objectives in this matter so
important to all of us are identical with yours, We are hopeful that
the improved controls desired can be put into operation without inpinging damagingly on the exile-American partnership which has in large
measure proved so beneficial.

Sincerely,
