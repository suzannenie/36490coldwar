Kennan (1904?2005) devised a way to resist the Soviet Union\\'s attempt to conquer the world for Communism. That way was to go to the brink of war to prevent war. His idea was first expressed in his famous Long Telegram from Moscow on February 22, 1946.It took genius to see a wartime ally as a dangerous adversary, and to convince the American leadership to act upon it. Back in the United States, the young diplomat first acted as deputy commandant in the National War College. He then operated as director of the State Department\\'s Policy Planning Staff to restore Europe from wartime destruction. By 1950 Kennan began to reverse his thinking, believing that the military component of American policy was going too far. While his old colleagues continued to develop US power, given point by the atomic bomb, Kennan withdrew from government and began a new career as a public intellectual campaigning for a more peaceable policy in his eighteen books, and articles and talks.The breakdown of the Soviet economy in the 1980s showed that Kennan was right the second time as well. Always sympathetic to the Russian people and culture, which the later Soviet leaders appreciated, Kennan was able to welcome the new non-Communist Russia into a more peaceable relationship with the democracies that ended the Cold War. His life and works have become a national treasure.\",\\n        \"industryIdentifiers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_13\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"9781351510240\"\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_10\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"135151024X\"\\n          }\\n        ],\\n        \"readingModes\": {\\n          \"text\": true,\\n          \"image\": true\\n        },\\n        \"pageCount\": 220,\\n        \"printType\": \"BOOK\",\\n        \"categories\": [\\n          \"History\"\\n        ],\\n        \"maturityRating\": \"NOT_MATURE\",\\n        \"allowAnonLogging\": false,\\n        \"contentVersion\": \"1.2.2.0.preview.3\",\\n        \"panelizationSummary\": {\\n          \"containsEpubBubbles\": false,\\n          \"containsImageBubbles\": false\\n        },\\n        \"imageLinks\": {\\n          \"smallThumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\\n          \"thumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"language\": \"en\",\\n        \"previewLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT74&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"infoLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"canonicalVolumeLink\": \"https://books.google.com/books/about/Kennan_and_the_Cold_War.html?hl=&id=tiExDwAAQBAJ\"\\n      },\\n      \"saleInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"saleability\": \"NOT_FOR_SALE\",\\n        \"isEbook\": false\\n      },\\n      \"accessInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"viewability\": \"PARTIAL\",\\n        \"embeddable\": true,\\n        \"publicDomain\": false,\\n        \"textToSpeechPermission\": \"ALLOWED\",\\n        \"epub\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true,\\n          \"acsTokenLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books/download/Kennan_and_the_Cold_War-sample-epub.acsm?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"pdf\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true,\\n          \"acsTokenLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books/download/Kennan_and_the_Cold_War-sample-pdf.acsm?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"webReaderLink\": \"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tiExDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"accessViewStatus\": \"SAMPLE\",\\n        \"quoteSharingAllowed\": false\\n      },\\n      \"searchInfo\": {\\n        \"textSnippet\": \"direction; Document 294: \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eKennan&#39;s\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e memorandum to Lovett listing five candidates for the chief of the (short-lived) OSP, including Frank G. \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e; Document 300: September 1, 1948, transforming the Office of Special Projects into the&nbsp;...\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"kind\": \"books#volume\",\\n      \"id\": \"FKN8AgAAQBAJ\",\\n      \"etag\": \"PXsZ6Bw3z0s\",\\n      \"selfLink\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/FKN8AgAAQBAJ\",\\n      \"volumeInfo\": {\\n        \"title\": \"US Covert Operations and Cold War Strategy\",\\n        \"subtitle\": \"Truman, Secret Warfare and the CIA, 1945-53\",\\n        \"authors\": [\\n          \"Sarah-Jane Corke\"\\n        ],\\n        \"publisher\": \"Routledge\",\\n        \"publishedDate\": \"2007-09-12\",\\n        \"description\": \"Based on recently declassified documents, this book provides the first examination of the Truman Administration’s decision to employ covert operations in the Cold War. Although covert operations were an integral part of America’s arsenal during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the majority of these operations were ill conceived, unrealistic and ultimately doomed to failure. In this volume, the author looks at three central questions: Why were these types of operations adopted? Why were they conducted in such a haphazard manner? And, why, once it became clear that they were not working, did the administration fail to abandon them? The book argues that the Truman Administration was unable to reconcile policy, strategy and operations successfully, and to agree on a consistent course of action for waging the Cold War.

and memoir, about the modern Freedom of Information Act—FOIA—and the horrifying, decades-old government misdeeds that it is unable to demystify, from one of America\\'s most celebrated writers Eight years ago, while investigating the possibility that the United States had used biological weapons in the Korean War, Nicholson Baker requested a series of Air Force documents from the early 1950s under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Years went by, and he got no response. Rather than wait forever, Baker set out to keep a personal journal of what it feels like to try to write about major historical events in a world of pervasive redactions, witheld records, and glacially slow governmental responses. The result is one of the most original and daring works of nonfiction in recent memory, a singular and mesmerizing narrative that tunnels into the history of some of the darkest and most shameful plans and projects of the CIA, the Air Force, and the presidencies of Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. In his lucid and unassuming style, Baker assembles what he learns, piece by piece, about Project Baseless, a crash Pentagon program begun in the early fifties that aimed to achieve \\\\\"an Air Force-wide combat capability in biological and chemical warfare at the earliest possible date.\\\\\" Along the way, he unearths stories of balloons carrying crop disease, leaflet bombs filled with feathers, suicidal scientists, leaky centrifuges, paranoid political-warfare tacticians, insane experiments on animals and humans, weaponized ticks, ferocious propaganda battles with China, and cover and deception plans meant to trick the Kremlin into ramping up its germ-warfare program. At the same time, Baker tells the stories of the heroic journalists and lawyers who have devoted their energies to wresting documentary evidence from government repositories, and he shares anecdotes from his daily life in Maine feeding his dogs and watching the morning light gather on the horizon. The result is an astonishing and utterly disarming story about waiting, bureaucracy, the horrors of war, and, above all, the cruel secrets that the United States government seems determined to keep forever from its citizens.\",\\n        \"industryIdentifiers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_13\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"9780735215764\"\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_10\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"0735215766\"\\n          }\\n        ],\\n        \"readingModes\": {\\n          \"text\": false,\\n          \"image\": false\\n        },\\n        \"pageCount\": 464,\\n        \"printType\": \"BOOK\",\\n        \"categories\": [\\n          \"Political Science\"\\n        ],\\n        \"maturityRating\": \"NOT_MATURE\",\\n        \"allowAnonLogging\": false,\\n        \"contentVersion\": \"0.1.0.0.preview.0\",\\n        \"panelizationSummary\": {\\n          \"containsEpubBubbles\": false,\\n          \"containsImageBubbles\": false\\n        },\\n        \"imageLinks\": {\\n          \"smallThumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9VQ0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\\n          \"thumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9VQ0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"language\": \"en\",\\n        \"previewLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=9VQ0EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"infoLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=9VQ0EAAAQBAJ&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"canonicalVolumeLink\": \"https://books.google.com/books/about/Baseless.html?hl=&id=9VQ0EAAAQBAJ\"\\n      },\\n      \"saleInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"saleability\": \"NOT_FOR_SALE\",\\n        \"isEbook\": false\\n      },\\n      \"accessInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"viewability\": \"PARTIAL\",\\n        \"embeddable\": true,\\n        \"publicDomain\": false,\\n        \"textToSpeechPermission\": \"ALLOWED\",\\n        \"epub\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": false\\n        },\\n        \"pdf\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": false\\n        },\\n        \"webReaderLink\": \"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9VQ0EAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"accessViewStatus\": \"SAMPLE\",\\n        \"quoteSharingAllowed\": false\\n      },\\n      \"searchInfo\": {\\n        \"textSnippet\": \"I came across one letter in the file from \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eKennan\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e to \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e , dated January 6 , 1949. “ Mr. \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e : I have examined carefully the volume entitled &#39; OPC Projects Fiscal 1949–1950 , ” \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eKennan\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e wrote . “ In my opinion , this presentation&nbsp;...\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"kind\": \"books#volume\",\\n      \"id\": \"bscODgAAQBAJ\",\\n      \"etag\": \"p5VenVN7Fxw\",\\n      \"selfLink\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/bscODgAAQBAJ\",\\n      \"volumeInfo\": {\\n        \"title\": \"Presidents\\' Secrets\",\\n        \"subtitle\": \"The Use and Abuse of Hidden Power\",\\n        \"authors\": [\\n          \"Mary Graham\"\\n        ],\\n        \"publisher\": \"Yale University Press\",\\n        \"publishedDate\": \"2017-01-01\",\\n        \"description\": \"Ever since the nation\\'s most important secret meeting--the Constitutional Convention--presidents have struggled to balance open, accountable government with necessary secrecy in military affairs and negotiations.

RFE-RL had its origins in a post-war America brimming with confidence and secure in its power. Unlike the Voice of America, which conveyed a distinctly American perspective on global events, RFE-RL served as surrogate home radio services and a vital alternative to the controlled, party-dominated domestic press in Eastern Europe. Over twenty stations featured programming tailored to individual countries. They reached millions of listeners ranging from industrial workers to dissident leaders such as Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel. Broadcasting Freedom draws on rare archival material and offers a penetrating insider history of the radios that helped change the face of Europe. Arch Puddington reveals new information about the connections between RFE-RL and the CIA, which provided covert funding for the stations during the critical start-up years in the early 1950s. He relates in detail the efforts of Soviet and Eastern Bloc officials to thwart the stations; their tactics ranged from jamming attempts, assassinations of radio journalists, the infiltration of spies onto the radios\\' staffs, and the bombing of the radios\\' headquarters. Puddington addresses the controversies that engulfed the stations throughout the Cold War, most notably RFE broadcasts during the Hungarian Revolution that were described as inflammatory and irresponsible. He shows how RFE prevented the Communist authorities from establishing a monopoly on the dissemination of information in Poland and describes the crucial roles played by the stations as the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union broke apart. Broadcasting Freedom is also a portrait of the Cold War in America. Puddington offers insights into the strategic thinking of the RFE-RL leadership and those in the highest circles of American government, including CIA directors, secretaries of state, and even presidents.\",\\n        \"industryIdentifiers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_13\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"9780813182650\"\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_10\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"0813182654\"\\n          }\\n        ],\\n        \"readingModes\": {\\n          \"text\": true,\\n          \"image\": true\\n        },\\n        \"pageCount\": 408,\\n        \"printType\": \"BOOK\",\\n        \"categories\": [\\n          \"History\"\\n        ],\\n        \"averageRating\": 5,\\n        \"ratingsCount\": 1,\\n        \"maturityRating\": \"NOT_MATURE\",\\n        \"allowAnonLogging\": false,\\n        \"contentVersion\": \"1.2.2.0.preview.3\",\\n        \"panelizationSummary\": {\\n          \"containsEpubBubbles\": false,\\n          \"containsImageBubbles\": false\\n        },\\n        \"imageLinks\": {\\n          \"smallThumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\\n          \"thumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"language\": \"en\",\\n        \"previewLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT27&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"infoLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"canonicalVolumeLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ\"\\n      },\\n      \"saleInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"saleability\": \"FOR_SALE\",\\n        \"isEbook\": true,\\n        \"listPrice\": {\\n          \"amount\": 12.95,\\n          \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n        },\\n        \"retailPrice\": {\\n          \"amount\": 12.95,\\n          \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n        },\\n        \"buyLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-90sgEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"offers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"finskyOfferType\": 1,\\n            \"listPrice\": {\\n              \"amountInMicros\": 12950000,\\n              \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n            },\\n            \"retailPrice\": {\\n              \"amountInMicros\": 12950000,\\n              \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n            },\\n            \"giftable\": true\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      },\\n      \"accessInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"viewability\": \"PARTIAL\",\\n        \"embeddable\": true,\\n        \"publicDomain\": false,\\n        \"textToSpeechPermission\": \"ALLOWED\",\\n        \"epub\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true\\n        },\\n        \"pdf\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true\\n        },\\n        \"webReaderLink\": \"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=90sgEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"accessViewStatus\": \"SAMPLE\",\\n        \"quoteSharingAllowed\": false\\n      },\\n      \"searchInfo\": {\\n        \"textSnippet\": \"... barbarism that pursued its interests unrestrained by moral or ethical standards.8 There is no credible written account relating the precise role that \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eKennan\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e, \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e, and other important officials intended for either the FEC or RFE.\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"kind\": \"books#volume\",\\n      \"id\": \"2vkBBAAAQBAJ\",\\n      \"etag\": \"qZUy3Q+H1TM\",\\n      \"selfLink\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/2vkBBAAAQBAJ\",\\n      \"volumeInfo\": {\\n        \"title\": \"A Certain Arrogance\",\\n        \"subtitle\": \"The Sacrificing of Lee Harvey Oswald and the Wartime Manipulation of Religious Groups by U.S. Intelligence\",\\n        \"authors\": [\\n          \"George Michael Evica\"\\n        ],\\n        \"publisher\": \"Trine Day\",\\n        \"publishedDate\": \"2011-02-01\",\\n        \"description\": \"Providing the first global cultural context for the assassination of John F.

Focusing on the manipulations of key individuals in the American Unitarian Association, the Unitarian Service Committee, and the Unitarian-supported Albert Schweitzer College by covert American interests during the Cold War, this exposé asserts that an unwitting Lee Harvey Oswald—an asset and pawn of American intelligence—was the ideal scapegoat in a tragically successful conspiracy to murder President Kennedy.\",\\n        \"industryIdentifiers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_13\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"9781936296637\"\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_10\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"1936296632\"\\n          }\\n        ],\\n        \"readingModes\": {\\n          \"text\": true,\\n          \"image\": true\\n        },\\n        \"pageCount\": 384,\\n        \"printType\": \"BOOK\",\\n        \"categories\": [\\n          \"History\"\\n        ],\\n        \"maturityRating\": \"NOT_MATURE\",\\n        \"allowAnonLogging\": false,\\n        \"contentVersion\": \"1.2.3.0.preview.3\",\\n        \"imageLinks\": {\\n          \"smallThumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\\n          \"thumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"language\": \"en\",\\n        \"previewLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT158&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"infoLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"canonicalVolumeLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ\"\\n      },\\n      \"saleInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"saleability\": \"FOR_SALE\",\\n        \"isEbook\": true,\\n        \"listPrice\": {\\n          \"amount\": 19.99,\\n          \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n        },\\n        \"retailPrice\": {\\n          \"amount\": 19.99,\\n          \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n        },\\n        \"buyLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2vkBBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"offers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"finskyOfferType\": 1,\\n            \"listPrice\": {\\n              \"amountInMicros\": 19990000,\\n              \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n            },\\n            \"retailPrice\": {\\n              \"amountInMicros\": 19990000,\\n              \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n            },\\n            \"giftable\": true\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      },\\n      \"accessInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"viewability\": \"PARTIAL\",\\n        \"embeddable\": true,\\n        \"publicDomain\": false,\\n        \"textToSpeechPermission\": \"ALLOWED\",\\n        \"epub\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true,\\n          \"acsTokenLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Certain_Arrogance-sample-epub.acsm?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"pdf\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true,\\n          \"acsTokenLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books/download/A_Certain_Arrogance-sample-pdf.acsm?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"webReaderLink\": \"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2vkBBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"accessViewStatus\": \"SAMPLE\",\\n        \"quoteSharingAllowed\": false\\n      },\\n      \"searchInfo\": {\\n        \"textSnippet\": \"For \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eKennan\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e, \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e, and Dulles,the Cold War “was themeans for tens of thousands of Nazi criminalsto avoid responsibility forthe murders they had committed.” Allen.

Both men came to power during World War II, reached their professional peaks during the Cold War\\'s most frightening moments, and fought epic political battles that spanned decades. Yet despite their very different views, Paul Nitze and George Kennan dined together, attended the weddings of each other\\'s children, and remained good friends all their lives. In this masterly double biography, Nicholas Thompson brings Nitze and Kennan to vivid life. Nitze—the hawk—was a consummate insider who believed that the best way to avoid a nuclear clash was to prepare to win one. More than any other American, he was responsible for the arms race. Kennan—the dove—was a diplomat turned academic whose famous \\\\\"X article\\\\\" persuasively argued that we should contain the Soviet Union while waiting for it to collapse from within. For forty years, he exercised more influence on foreign affairs than any other private citizen. As he weaves a fascinating narrative that follows these two rivals and friends from the beginning of the Cold War to its end, Thompson accomplishes something remarkable: he tells the story of our nation during the most dangerous half century in history.\",\\n        \"industryIdentifiers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_13\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"9781429940504\"\\n          },\\n          {\\n            \"type\": \"ISBN_10\",\\n            \"identifier\": \"1429940506\"\\n          }\\n        ],\\n        \"readingModes\": {\\n          \"text\": true,\\n          \"image\": false\\n        },\\n        \"pageCount\": 416,\\n        \"printType\": \"BOOK\",\\n        \"categories\": [\\n          \"History\"\\n        ],\\n        \"averageRating\": 4,\\n        \"ratingsCount\": 1,\\n        \"maturityRating\": \"NOT_MATURE\",\\n        \"allowAnonLogging\": true,\\n        \"contentVersion\": \"0.6.7.0.preview.2\",\\n        \"panelizationSummary\": {\\n          \"containsEpubBubbles\": false,\\n          \"containsImageBubbles\": false\\n        },\\n        \"imageLinks\": {\\n          \"smallThumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\\n          \"thumbnail\": \"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"language\": \"en\",\\n        \"previewLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&pg=PA85&dq=kennan+wisner&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"infoLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"canonicalVolumeLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC\"\\n      },\\n      \"saleInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"saleability\": \"FOR_SALE\",\\n        \"isEbook\": true,\\n        \"listPrice\": {\\n          \"amount\": 11.99,\\n          \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n        },\\n        \"retailPrice\": {\\n          \"amount\": 11.99,\\n          \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n        },\\n        \"buyLink\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&rdid=book-8ymLk_6mSTMC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"offers\": [\\n          {\\n            \"finskyOfferType\": 1,\\n            \"listPrice\": {\\n              \"amountInMicros\": 11990000,\\n              \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n            },\\n            \"retailPrice\": {\\n              \"amountInMicros\": 11990000,\\n              \"currencyCode\": \"USD\"\\n            },\\n            \"giftable\": true\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      },\\n      \"accessInfo\": {\\n        \"country\": \"US\",\\n        \"viewability\": \"PARTIAL\",\\n        \"embeddable\": true,\\n        \"publicDomain\": false,\\n        \"textToSpeechPermission\": \"ALLOWED\",\\n        \"epub\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": true,\\n          \"acsTokenLink\": \"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Hawk_and_the_Dove-sample-epub.acsm?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api\"\\n        },\\n        \"pdf\": {\\n          \"isAvailable\": false\\n        },\\n        \"webReaderLink\": \"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8ymLk_6mSTMC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api\",\\n        \"accessViewStatus\": \"SAMPLE\",\\n        \"quoteSharingAllowed\": false\\n      },\\n      \"searchInfo\": {\\n        \"textSnippet\": \"According to a document released by the CIA in 2006, \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eKennan\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e thanked \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e in October 1948 for taking Hilger on at the OPC, and ended by praising \\\\u003cb\\\\u003eWisner\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e for not only getting Hilger into the country but also sneaking his family out of&nbsp;...\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n'"
